Infinite Stacks Heuristic:
    
    HeuristicPrep:
        Create a dictionary with every stack as a key + one key which has the minimum cost to a stack without the goal cask. 
            On each entry is a dictionary indexed by each node, wich has the cost to go from that node to the stack.
        
        Find the stack with the goal cask [DONE IN PREVIOUS HEURISTIC]
    
    HCost:
        If robot is carrying nothing:
            HCost = cost to go to where the stack with the goal cask is + 
                  + cost to load + unload all the casks above the goal cask + cost to load the goal cask [DONE IN PREVIOUS HEURISTIC]
                  + cost to move to and from the nearest stack (from the stack with goal cask) once per every cask above the goal cask 
                  + cost to move to exit (with the goal cask)
        If robot is carrying a cask which is not the goal cask:
            HCost = cost to unload the cask being carried [DONE IN PREVIOUS HEURISTIC]
                  + cost to go to the nearest stack without the goal cask
                  + cost to go to where the stack with the goal cask is 
                  + cost to load + unload all the casks above the goal cask + cost to load the goal cask [DONE IN PREVIOUS HEURISTIC]
                  + cost to move to and from the nearest stack (from the stack with goal cask) once per every cask above the goal cask 
                  + cost to move to exit (with the goal cask)
        If robot is carrying the goal cask:
            HCost = cost to move to exit (with the goal cask);

BAN UNLOADING WHEN CARRYING THE GOAL CASK - Done
