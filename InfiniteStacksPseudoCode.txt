Infinite Stacks Heuristic:
    
    HeuristicPrep:
        Create a dictionary with every stack as a key. 
            On each entry is a dictionary indexed by each node, wich has the cost to go from that node to the stack.
        
        Create a dictionary, like above, indexed by each node, wich has the cost to go from that node to the EXIT.
        
        Find the stack with the goal cask [DONE IN TELPORTING ROBOT]
    
    HCost:
        If robot is carrying nothing:
            HCost = cost to go to the stack which has the goal cask [DONE IN GHOST ROBOT]
                  + cost to load + unload all the casks above the goal cask + cost to load the goal cask [DONE IN TELPORTING ROBOT]
                  
                  + cost to move to and from the nearest stack (from the stack with goal cask) once per every cask above the goal cask [DONE IN INFINITE STACKS]
                  
                  + cost to move to exit (with the goal cask) [DONE IN GHOST ROBOT]
        
        If robot is carrying a cask which is not the goal cask:
            HCost = cost to unload the cask being carried [DONE IN TELPORTING ROBOT]
                
                  + cost to go to the nearest stack without the goal cask       \
                  + cost to go to the stack with the goal cask from said stack  |- This part is wrong - it can overestimate the cost. It will not be implemented for now
                  
                  + cost to load + unload all the casks above the goal cask + cost to load the goal cask [DONE IN TELPORTING ROBOT]
                  
                  + cost to move to and from the nearest stack (from the stack with goal cask) once per every cask above the goal cask [DONE IN INFINITE STACKS]
                  
                  + cost to move to exit (with the goal cask) [DONE IN GHOST ROBOT]
        
        If robot is carrying the goal cask:
            HCost = cost to move to exit (with the goal cask); [DONE IN GHOST ROBOT]

BAN UNLOADING WHEN CARRYING THE GOAL CASK - Done
